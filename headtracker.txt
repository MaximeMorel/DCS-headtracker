Interface for head tracker devices.

Support of head tracker devices implemented like a plugin system. 
Simulator tries to load .dll using path written in file scripts/input/input.lua.
By default it is "bin/headtracker/headtracker.dll":

-- path to headtracker plugin dll
setHeadTrackerDllPath('./bin/headtracker/headtracker.dll')

Plugin dll implements set of functions described in HeadtrackerDll.h.
Some functions can be omitted.
Functions list:


HEADTRACKERDLL_API int initHeadTracker(HWND hwnd);

Initialization of device. Returns 0 if initialization was unsuccessful.
hwnd - handler of main application window. This function cannot be omitted.


HEADTRACKERDLL_API void shutDownHeadTracker();

Optional deinitialization of device. Called before unload headtracker .dll.


HEADTRACKERDLL_API void requestHeadTrackerData(struct HeadTrackerData* data);

Client informs device which data he would like to receive. 
If device cannot transmit data from some axis it informs client about it. Cannot be omitted.


HEADTRACKERDLL_API int getHeadTrackerData(struct HeadTrackerData* data);

Client recievs data from device. Only axes verified in requestHeadTrackerData() will be send to simulator.  Returns non-zero on success. This function is mandatory.


For convinience every function typedefed in HeadtrackerDll.h.

Structure HeadTrackerData is:

struct HeadTrackerData
{
  // version of HeadTrackerData (for future releases)
  double version;

  // axes values
  // values must be in range [-1; 1]
  double pitch;
  double yaw;
  double roll;
  double x;
  double y;
  double z;
};

Value of every axis must be in range [-1; 1]. Field "version" filled by client and necessary for future compatibility.
Current version is 1.0.
